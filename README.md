# Next.js 15 Link Component Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with the Next.js 15 Link component where links do not function correctly. The `Link` component fails to route to the intended page.  The example uses the simplest setup of a main page linking to an about page.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Click the "Go to About Page" link.  You'll find that it does not navigate correctly.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect configuration:** A possible configuration error in the Next.js application, such as an issue with `next.config.js`, might be interfering with routing.
* **Conflicting libraries:** A conflict between the Next.js Link component and another library affecting the functionality.
* **Bug in Next.js 15:** Although less likely, there might be a bug in the Next.js 15 version used.

## Solution

The problem can be solved by ensuring the application's routing is correctly set up.  In this case, verifying file paths and Next.js app structure will suffice.  Refer to the solution file for a corrected version of the files.
